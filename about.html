              Welcome to Hair Force One, a modern spin on the traditional
              Italian barbershop. We provide a special environment designed to
              embrace a man’s masculinity, minus all the macho. Simply put, we
              are the “Better Barbershop” that offers an inviting environment to
              guys who value quality, particularly with their grooming. Whether
              you’re looking for a Classic Cut or prefer to go the extra mile
              with a straight razor face shave or beard trim, we’ll make sure
              you look great and feel even better.

            <p class="about-p">
              The Hair Force concept emerged from the fusion of talents and
              experiences of two industry icons, Frank Smith and Gordon Paul.
              Smith first founded John's Barbershop in 2010, which has been
              named a “Best Barbershop in America” multiple times by several
              publications. He brings his award-winning experience to Hair Force
              One and is dedicated to excellence. As one of the top stylists in
              the country, he is highly sought after and trains his barbers and
              stylists to ensure every client gets the perfect, personalized
              attention they deserve.
              <br />
              <br />
              Gordon Paul comes to Hair Force One from the Sport Clips Haircuts
              concept, which in the early 1990s took advantage of the lack of
              competition in the men’s and boys’ haircut market. Sport Clips
              grew quickly and is a great example of how to build and establish
              a successful business.
